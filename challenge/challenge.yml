  We design a pretty easy contract challenge. Enjoy it!
  Your goal is to make isSolved() function returns true!
  Failed with solidity? Why not try python web3?

flag: flag{placeholder}

constructor:
  args: [ "hello" ]
  value: 0
  #gas: 1000000          # The default value is the response value of the eth_estimateGas JSON-RPC


show_source: True      # Show source option available by default, you need to set False for a reverse contract challenge
#solved_event: SendFlag  # The default is to use isSolved() view function as solved checker, but emitted event checker is also supported
